(not all colors are displayed correctly in asciinema)

I made another terminal game! This time, it's Tetris!

I used the letter names of each tetromino as the tetromino itself. The colors of the tetromino are all the same, as well.

I tried as hard as I can to make this game as similar to the real Tetris games. Tried to keep it all the same dimensions and everything. Enjoy!

There is some configuration you can edit in the source file. (The original is from the Tetris Guidelines)

The keyboard controls are the same controls modern Tetris games use. Enjoy!
